# Background: Into the woods

We looked at NEON woods survey data, focusing on **stem diameter**, **height**, and the **form** of the vegetation.



# Analysis
## Aims
We wanted to see if there was a relationship between stem diameter and height

## Coding
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::read_chunk(here::here("analysis.R")) 
```

```{r analysis-setup, echo = TRUE}

```

```{r analysis-filter-data}

```

```{r analysis-set-factor-levels}

```

```{r analysis-fig1-barplot}

```


```{r analysis-fig2-violinplots}

```

```{r analysis-lm-overall}

```

```{r analysis-lm-fig3-overall}

```

```{r analysis-lm-growth}

```

```{r analysis-lm-fig4-growth}
